# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Car
Description:
This project makes it possible to control car with hand gestures via wireless communication. Hand controller contains 5 flex sensors whose resistance changes upon bending acting as a transmitter. The resistance values measured by bending are the analog values. These values are compared with the threshold values in the code and the functions are executed on the robotic car with dual DC motor acting as a receiver. 

Technology stack:
C Programming Language, Visual Studio Code as Editor, and GCC.

Components:
ATmega32 Microcontroller Board
Flex Sensors
Bluetooth Module HC-05
DC Motors
Wheels
